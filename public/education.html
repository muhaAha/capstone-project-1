                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My best school experience was when I for the first time visit to school <em>"Goce Delchev"</em>
                                         in my beloved village Podgorci. From that day until today, I am in love with education (if I could say so).
                                        In those ages, I have gained learning skills that I use until today.

                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On September 1987, I stept at class that will show me the path that will and I am still walking.
                                        All my elementary school went <strong>excellent</strong>. In there I met and really liked to play foodball.
                                        My drawing, and later my 3D modeling, skills were discovered and builded there. For the sake of truth, in 
                                        Macedonia at that time we didn`t study <em>English language</em>, instead we were studying <em>French language</em>.
                                        My love and devotion to the english language came from the tv receiver.<br />
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All my knewledge, skills and love for physics, mechanical engineering and engineering drawing 
                                        with 3D modeling came from this basic learning experience. I am grateful to my teacher 
                                        <strong>Stojan Kukuneshoski</strong> for great 4 years together teaching me, and believing in me; also to
                                        the rest of the rest of the school board.

                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On September 1994, I went not at my path, but on path that my parents loved me to go.
                                        I enrolled in general gymnasium at HS"Niko Nestor" in Struga. It was one og two possibilities to to continue 
                                        тхе education at Medicine Faculty at that days in Macedonia.<br />
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is my past mixed with good and bad memories. But I passed with a very good result.
                                        That's when I earned my very first degree. Which is a proof of skills and knewledge that I have
                                        improved.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Instead of going on to medical faculty, I have decided to enroll in mechanical engineering.
                                        On year 1999th I have enrolled engineering studies at <abbr title="UKIM">"University St. Cyril and Methodius"</abbr> 
                                        in Skopje. I had a great first year od studies. But in 2000th and 2001th year civil war broke out. After that, 
                                        it was very difical to study as muslim and non-macedonian. I graduated here, but I was 7 examps back, so I didn`t 
                                        have got a digree. There were nationalist and chauvinist teachers, especially form Bitola and Prilep cityes, 
                                        who which hindered my further progress in my studies. My talents were at stake!<br />
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So because of that situation, with 7 exams to pass, I have left the faculty and in 2011th year I moved to 
                                        <abbr title="UNITE">University of Tetova</abbr>. After some years, I have finished successfully my studies there.<br />
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What is imoptant for me to mention is that I had interest in Java programming language 3D modeling and Linux 
                                        command shell (bash) before I went to Tetovo. At that time I had great skills in those areas.<br />
                                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At Faculty of Applied Science in <abbr title="University of Tetova">UNITE</abbr> I earned my degree 
                                        as a bachelor of science mechatronics engineer. I am proud of the great teachers, the modern teaching methods and the european 
                                        academical environment there. On this occasion greet the vice-chancellor <strong>Hazir Polozhani</strong>, really great person 
                                        and humanist.

                                        I have learned everything about technical expression and drawing; especiali 3D modeling. I have gained
                                        great skills in AutoCAD 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software application developed by Autodesk.
                                        In fact I was the best student at that course.

                                        many projects. But because it was the learning period none of the buildet applicationa was published, or used.
                                        Eclips was IDE that had everything what I needed to write, interpret, compilet and edited my byte code 
                                        (that is hmae ov java`s source code); also I used it for packaging the applications.<br />

                                        a programming language through which I will create and manage databases. So I started to learn SQL.
                                        For my project - meant for mobile - I used SQLite. But MySQL is what in used in other cases. Pre intsalling 
                                        the MySQL server is nothing for a skilled programmer like I am.
